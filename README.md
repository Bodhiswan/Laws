Laws of my life

This file will act as a set of laws for which I will follow. I will separate them into THREE categories: STRONG and WEAK laws.
STRONG laws can only be removed after 30 days of continuous request and can only be added if it has existed as a WEAK law for more than 10 days. WEAK laws can only be added and removed once per day.

I will always follow these laws to the best of my ability. These laws will supersede all other laws and regulations to which I am subject. While some may seem irrelevant or useless, they are all to be considered of equal worth.

This repository is a way to track changes to the laws, and should not be seen as the complete set of laws which I shall be following.
